**Real-Time Adversarial Detection in Autonomous Driving**

**Overview**

This project focuses on detecting adversarial attacks in autonomous driving systems. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ensemble learning with Random Forest and SVM classifiers to identify adversarial images. The model also emphasizes precision and recall metrics to ensure reliable and safe detection in real-time autonomous driving applications.

**Project Workflow**

1.  **Data Parsing and Preprocessing**:
    
    *   Load image data from TFRecord files (typically from autonomous vehicle sensors).
        
    *   Apply preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images with random flips, brightness, and contrast adjustments to improve robustness.
        
2.  **Labeling and Dataset Preparation**:
    
    *   Generate binary labels to identify normal vs. adversarial examples.
        
    *   Prepare the dataset by shuffling, batching, and repeating samples for training.
        
3.  **CNN Model Construction and Training**:
    
    *   Build a CNN with convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers to extract image features.
        
    *   Use dropout to prevent overfitting and binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification.
        
    *   Train the CNN on labeled data to classify normal and adversarial images.
        
4.  **Random Forest Classifier**:
    
    *   Feed CNN-extracted features to a Random Forest Classifier as a second model.
        
    *   Evaluate Random Forest using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
        
5.  **Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    
    *   Perform Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters like the number of trees, tree depth, and splitting criteria for Random Forest.
        
6.  **Ensemble Model**:
    
    *   Combine CNN and Random Forest predictions through an ensemble approach.
        
    *   Introduce a Voting Classifier that combines Random Forest and SVM to enhance the ensemble's robustness.
        
7.  **Anomaly Detection**:
    
    *   Use Random Forest probability outputs to identify anomalies (e.g., outliers or potential adversarial attacks).
        
8.  **Final Evaluation**:
    
    *   Evaluate the ensemble model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
        
    *   Focus on balancing precision and recall to minimize both false positives and false negatives in detecting adversarial attacks.
        

**Model Metrics**

*   **Precision (66.67%)**: Indicates that the model correctly identifies adversarial attacks about two-thirds of the time. This is important to prevent false alarms in autonomous driving.
    
*   **Recall (42.86%)**: The model captures around half of actual adversarial attacks, highlighting room for improvement.
    
*   **F1 Score (52.17%)**: Balances precision and recall, suggesting the model is reliable but needs tuning to improve recall.
    

**Conclusion**

This adversarial detection model is reasonably precise but has moderate recall, meaning it could miss some adversarial attacks. To improve safety in autonomous driving, future efforts might focus on enhancing recall through model adjustments or further optimization of ensemble methods.

**Key Takeaways**

*   **Precision**: Ensures reliability in identifying adversarial attacks, reducing false positives.
    
*   **Recall**: Aims to catch as many adversarial attacks as possible to ensure system safety.
    
*   **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, with a current score of 52.17%.
